[![](https://vueschool.io/media/ed5620513b0736fa20445ecd42869cd5/whats-new-in-vue-3.png)](https://vueschool.io/courses/whats-new-in-vue-3)

This repository contains the example code for the [What is new in Vue 3](https://vueschool.io/courses/whats-new-in-vue-3) course.

Learn all the exciting new features, improvements, and breaking changes that Vue 3 introduces.

**By the end of this course, you’ll know:**

- How to leverage the Teleport and Suspense features
- How to use multiple v-models
- How to use fragments to have multiple root elements in a component
- The fundamentals of Composition API
- The new automatic change detection and how it eliminates known reactivity caveats of Vue 2
- How to make transparent wrapper components easier with Vue 3
- What `<script setup>` and `<style vars>` are and when/how to use them
- And much more

**Important**
Vue 3 does not introduce many breaking changes. The breaking changes are covered in this course, and we provide you with solutions for your upgrade process and workarounds where needed.

This means that it doesn’t require a lot of effort from Vue 2 developers to learn Vue 3, or to upgrade existing applications and websites.


**Prerequisites**
In this course, you will not learn Vue.js from scratch. If you are looking to get started with Vue.js, please check out our [Vue.js Fundamentals course](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-fundamentals).

**Next Steps**
Once you complete this course, we recommend you to expand your Composition API knowledge by diving into our [In-depth Vue 3 Composition API course](https://vueschool.io/courses/vue-3-composition-api).
